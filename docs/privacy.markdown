Privacy Policy
==============

### The Gist

SGBusFree will collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you as you use our app. We may use this data to better understand our users. We can also publish this data, but the data will be about a large group of users, not individuals.

That's the basic idea, but you must read through the entire Privacy Policy below and agree with all the details before you use any of our app.

### Reuse

This document is based upon the [Automattic Privacy Policy](http://automattic.com/privacy/) and is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License 2.5](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/). Basically, this means you can use it verbatim or edited, but you must release new versions under the same license and you have to credit Automattic somewhere (like this!). Automattic is not connected with and does not sponsor or endorse SGBusFree or its use of the work.

SGBusFree makes available services, and services offered by SGBusFree in connection to any of those (taken together, the "Service"). It is SGBusFree's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our app.

### Questions

If you have question about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via our github page.

### Visitors

Like most website operators, SGBusFree collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SGBusFree's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SGBusFree's visitors use its website. From time to time, SGBusFree may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

SGBusFree also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. SGBusFree does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to SGBusFree's webapp choose to interact with SGBusFree in ways that require SGBusFree to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that SGBusFree gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. SGBusFree collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with SGBusFree. SGBusFree does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.

Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for optional personal information. For instance, when posting a comment, may provide a website that will be displayed along with a user's name when the comment is displayed. Supplying such personal information is completely optional and is only displayed for the benefit and the convenience of the user.

### Aggregated Statistics

SGBusFree may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Service. For instance, SGBusFree may monitor the most popular parts of our app. SGBusFree may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, SGBusFree does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Data Storage
SGBusFree uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service. You understand that although you retain full rights to your data, it may be stored on third party storage and transmitted through third party networks.

### Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, SGBusFree may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in SGBusFree's sole discretion. SGBusFree encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
